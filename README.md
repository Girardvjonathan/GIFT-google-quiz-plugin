# GIFT-google-quiz-plugin
**GIFT Quiz Editor** was created to help instructors create quizzes with the [GIFT syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIFT_\(file_format\)).

GIFT is a short, intuitive and normalized syntax used originally in the Moodle community to create quiz questions.
It allows storing quiz questions in a textual format that can be versionned, shared and easily modified.

Several aspects of GIFT are not fully supported, because Google's Quizzes and its API are limited in functionality.

This project was done by Jonathan G.V. under the supervision of [Christopher Fuhrman](https://etsmtl.ca/Professeurs/cfuhrman/Accueil?lang=en-CA) 
during a special project in the fall semester of 2017 at [École de technologie supérieure (ETS) Montréal](https://www.etsmtl.ca). 

It uses a parser generated by [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org) from the [GIFT grammar in PEG.js](https://github.com/fuhrmanator/GIFT-grammar-PEG.js). 

You can submit issues, requests and comments on this github repository.

### How to update the parser

- `npm run-script build` for the GIFT-grammer-PEG.js project.
- copy the `gift-parser-globals.js` and `gift-parser-globalsJS.html` files to this project.


### How to use clasp

- `clasp pull` to get the code from `script.google.com` project space
- `clasp push` to put it back

Note that these commands take ALL THE FILES and there's no intelligent merging like in git.
