      <b>GIFT Quiz Editor</b> was created to help instructors create quizzes with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIFT_(file_format)">GIFT syntax</a>.
      </p>
      <p>GIFT is a short, intuitive and standardized syntax used originally in the Moodle community to create quiz questions.
      It allows to storing quiz questions in a textual format that can be versioned, shared and easily modified.</p>
      <p>Several aspects of GIFT are not fully supported in Google Quiz, but Google's always evolving.</p>
      <p>
      This project was first done by Jonathan G.V. under the supervision of <a href="https://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman">Christopher Fuhrman</a> 
      during a special project in the fall semester of 2017 at <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca">École de technologie supérieure (ETS) Montréal</a>. 
      It uses a parser generated by <a href="https://pegjs.org">PEG.js</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/fuhrmanator/GIFT-grammar-PEG.js">GIFT grammar in PEG.js</a>. 
      You can submit issues, requests and comments about the GIFT Quiz Editor add-on at the github repository: <a href="https://github.com/fuhrmanator/GIFT-google-quiz-plugin">GIFT-google-quiz-plugin</a>.
